# SUPER GONGIK Rules Engine

## 1. Why a rules engine exists
Service, leave, and compensation behavior can change by policy year, effective date, or user context. Hard-coding these rules across UI components creates silent errors and makes historical results impossible to explain.

Policy logic therefore lives in versioned rule data plus deterministic calculation functions.

## 2. Rule domains
Initial domains:
- SERVICE
- LEAVE
- COMPENSATION

Potential future domains:
- NOTIFICATION
- ELIGIBILITY
- KNOWLEDGE

## 3. Rule file contract
Each rule bundle should contain:

```json
{
  "id": "compensation.kr.social-service.2026",
  "domain": "COMPENSATION",
  "version": "2026.1",
  "effectiveFrom": "2026-01-01",
  "effectiveUntil": "2026-12-31",
  "jurisdiction": "KR",
  "status": "VERIFIED",
  "source": {
    "title": "Official source title",
    "url": "https://...",
    "verifiedAt": "2026-08-30"
  },
  "rules": {}
}
```

A rule file is not considered production-ready without source metadata.

## 4. Rule selection
Rule selection must be deterministic.

Inputs:
- domain
- calculation date
- service profile context

Output:
- exactly one applicable rule bundle or an explicit unsupported state

Never silently fall back to a newer or older year when no verified rule applies.

## 5. Calculation contract
Each calculation returns more than a number.

```ts
type CalculationResult<T> = {
  value: T
  ruleId: string
  ruleVersion: string
  effectiveDate: string
  inputs: Record<string, unknown>
  breakdown: Record<string, unknown>
  warnings: string[]
}
```

This enables explainable UI and reproducible historical results.

## 6. Compensation calculation flow

```text
service profile
+ month
+ service events
+ user overrides
        |
        v
select compensation rule
        |
        v
normalize billable/eligible days
        |
        v
calculate components
        |
        +-- base pay
        +-- meal allowance
        +-- transport allowance
        +-- supported adjustments
        |
        v
result + explanation + warnings
```

The product must label values as estimates when official payment may differ due to institution-specific processing or unsupported exceptions.

## 7. Leave calculation flow

```text
leave credits
+ leave events
+ applicable leave rule
        |
        v
normalize duration to minutes
        |
        v
apply charging rules
        |
        v
balance + ledger explanation
```

Do not assume one day always equals a globally fixed number of minutes. The rule or profile context must define conversion behavior.

## 8. Historical rules
When a user views a past month, the app should prefer the rule version stored in the calculation snapshot.

If the user explicitly requests recalculation:
- preserve the previous snapshot
- generate a new snapshot
- show that the result was recalculated under a different rule version

## 9. Verification states
Recommended states:
- DRAFT
- VERIFIED
- SUPERSEDED
- RETIRED

Only VERIFIED rules may be used automatically in production calculations.

## 10. Rule tests
Every rule bundle must ship with test fixtures.

Example categories:
- first/last effective date
- month boundary
- leap day when relevant
- partial-day leave
- overlapping events
- unsupported event combination
- historical snapshot replay

## 11. Source maintenance
For each rule bundle maintain:
- source title
- canonical source URL
- effective date
- last verified date
- internal maintainer note if interpretation is non-obvious

If a policy source becomes unavailable, keep the rule but mark verification status appropriately until revalidated.

## 12. User-facing transparency
Calculation detail screens should expose:
- rule version
- effective date
- source title
- last verified date
- assumptions
- warnings

The user should never have to trust a mysterious total produced by invisible conditionals.
