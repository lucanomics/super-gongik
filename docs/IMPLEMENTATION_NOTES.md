# Foundation implementation notes

## Implemented boundaries

- `packages/domain` owns deterministic Seoul civil-date handling, the guest service profile, 21-calendar-month discharge-date derivation, D-Day, and progress.
- `packages/rules` parses the source-derived JSON bundles, selects a single effective rule version, and returns an explainable calculation contract and replayable snapshot.
- `apps/web` is a guest-first Next.js PWA shell. It stores only the profile in local storage and never places policy logic in React components.

## Safety gates retained by design

- The 2026 meal rate of KRW 9,000 is surfaced only as a suggested value until the profile has confirmation context.
- Transport requires a user-entered fare or institution-approved transport rate.
- Partial service months and prior-service credit return a gated result rather than a guessed amount.
- Missing, ambiguous, or out-of-range effective-date rules return an explicit unsupported result; selection never falls back to a newer or older bundle.

## Verification

`packages/rules/fixtures/2026-boundaries.json` is executed directly by the rules test suite. The test cases cover the 2026-08-27/28 leave boundary, ordinary leave at 21 months, compensation pay-band boundaries, suggested meal status, transport context, and automatic-calculation gates.
